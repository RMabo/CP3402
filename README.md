### Rehearsal Insights
The initial rehearsals highlighted several gaps in our presentation, particularly in the transitions between sections and the clarity of our main arguments. By the third rehearsal, we had significantly improved our flow and confidence. The feedback from group members was instrumental in refining our content, especially in making our key points more concise and impactful. The technical checks ensured no surprises on the actual presentation day regarding equipment compatibility and display settings.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This rehearsal process underscored the importance of preparation and flexibility in any professional setting. The ability to receive and incorporate feedback effectively is crucial for personal and professional development. Moreover, mastering presentation skills, such as public speaking and technical troubleshooting, is invaluable and can distinguish an individual in the job market. Practising in a realistic environment, with attention to detail such as lighting and sound, prepared us for the academic assignment and real-world scenarios where clear and effective communication is key.
